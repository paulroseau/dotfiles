  - [x] read https://tao-of-tmux.readthedocs.io
    - [x] checkout tmux capture-pane, tmux save-buffer
      -> ok capture-pane saves you from getting into copy-mode and selecting
      -> to paste you can use `Prefix+]` or use `:paste-buffer`, you can also send it to stdout
  - [ ] make status bar pretty
    - status line can print output of a command at regular interval
    - checkout https://medium.com/hackernoon/customizing-tmux-b3d2a5050207 for more help
    - checkout https://tao-of-tmux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuscript/09-status-bar.html
    - looks like the only nice on-the-shelf thing for that is powerline, let's see how it plays, you can also toggle the status bar on and off, but I guess you want it always there
    - would be nice to style the window list as well, not sure powerline can do that

- neovim
  - [X] update mapping to switch window with wincmd (we need to remain in Terminal mode after leaving and coming back), then commit
  - [X] install toggle term ASAP https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim
  - [X] try to replace <C-s> and <C-v> in FZF by <M-s> and <M-v>, same for helptags
  - [X] intall flatten:
  - [X] Check youtube series on Lunar Nvim (distro): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ
  - [ ] install LSP for C (lots to add in here)
    - [x] test the nvim-cmp setup
    - [ ] install LSP server for C in nix (maybe that is a good occasion to do the nix stuff above)
    - [ ] checkout how nvim-cmp works with LSP
  - [ ] read about https://computationstructures.org/lectures/interrupts/interrupts.html
  - [ ] update the notes on ComputerArchitecture especially about asynchronous IOs
  - [ ] Once that is done explore libluv and understand how IOs are handled
  - [ ] then you should be able to understand flatten.nvim with the use of sockopen and pipes which maps to libuv under the hood (decompose al the way down to the processor level)
  - [ ] understand the pipe / NVIM env variable
  - [ ] configure lua-line
  - [ ] install LSP for Rust
  - [ ] install LSP for Scala
  - [ ] install LSP for Haskell
