- nix
  - [ ] upgrade nix
  - [ ] start using `nix` directly instead of `nix-env` and `nix-store`
  - [ ] add nix config to avoid long feature flags
  - [ ] investigate if there is a way to delete old nix-channel user-environment to perform a full `nix-store --gc`
  - [ ] upgrade channel, and reinstall everything make sure nothing breaks before deleting the previous versions for roll back (in particular checkout fzf line grepping works - it crashes on the cloudtop)

- tmux
  - [x] read https://tao-of-tmux.readthedocs.io
    - [x] checkout tmux capture-pane, tmux save-buffer
      -> ok capture-pane saves you from getting into copy-mode and selecting
      -> to paste you can use `Prefix+]` or use `:paste-buffer`, you can also send it to stdout
  - [ ] make status bar pretty
    - status line can print output of a command at regular interval
    - checkout https://medium.com/hackernoon/customizing-tmux-b3d2a5050207 for more help
    - checkout https://tao-of-tmux.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manuscript/09-status-bar.html
    - looks like the only nice on-the-shelf thing for that is powerline, let's see how it plays, you can also toggle the status bar on and off, but I guess you want it always there
    - would be nice to style the window list as well, not sure powerline can do that

- neovim
  - [x] update mapping to switch window with wincmd (we need to remain in Terminal mode after leaving and coming back), then commit
  - [x] install toggle term ASAP https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim
  - [x] try to replace <C-s> and <C-v> in FZF by <M-s> and <M-v>, same for helptags
  - [x] intall flatten:
  - [x] Check youtube series on Lunar Nvim (distro): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhoH5vyxr6Qq41NFL4GvhFp-WLd5xzIzZ
  - [ ] proceed to install LSP for C code (lots to add in here)
    - [x] test the nvim-cmp setup
    - [ ] install LSP server for C in nix (maybe that is a good occasion to do the nix stuff above)
    - [ ] checkout how nvim-cmp works with LSP
  - [ ] proceed to install LSP for Rust code
  - [ ] proceed to install LSP for Go code
  - [ ] read about https://computationstructures.org/lectures/interrupts/interrupts.html
  - [ ] update the notes on ComputerArchitecture especially about asynchronous IOs
  - [ ] Once that is done explore libluv and understand how IOs are handled
  - [ ] then you should be able to understand flatten.nvim with the use of sockopen and pipes which maps to libuv under the hood
  - [ ] understand the pipe / NVIM env variable
  - [ ] configure lua-line
